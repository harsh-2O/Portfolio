# Resume Folder

Place your resume files in this folder to make them available for download from your portfolio website.

## How to Update Your Resume

1. Simply replace the `resume.pdf` file in this folder with your latest resume
2. Keep the filename as `resume.pdf` to ensure the download button works without code changes
3. If you want to provide multiple resume formats, you can add them here and update the button in the Home.tsx file

## Current Files

- `resume.pdf` - Your main resume file that users can download from the portfolio

## Technical Notes

The download button in the portfolio is configured to open `/assets/resume/resume.pdf` in a new browser tab, which will trigger the download or preview depending on the user's browser settings.
